# Airbnb Booking

## Airbnb Booking is a simple Java application that will allow users to reserve, cancel, and view dates for an Airbnb.

## This app is targeted towards users who are planning a vacation or looking for a place to stay.

## This project interests me because I always organize and plan my schedule in a calendar, so I thought it would be nice to create an app that had similar features.

### DISCLAIMER: I did not realize my user stories did not fulfill the adding an arbitrary amount of X to Ys requirement during phase 0. I changed my stories and adapted my application to fulfill this requirement.
