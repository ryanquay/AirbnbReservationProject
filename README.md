# Airbnb Booking

## Airbnb Booking is a simple Java application that will allow users to reserve, cancel, and view dates for an Airbnb.

## This app is targeted towards users who are planning a vacation or looking for a place to stay.

## This project interests me because I always organize and plan my schedule in a calendar, so I thought it would be nice to create an app that had similar features.

## **User Stories:**
- As a customer, I want to be able to **input** a first and last name
- As a customer, I want to be able to **view** all the available dates
- As a customer, I want to be able to **make** reservations 
- As a customer, I want to be able to **remove** reservations 
- As an owner, I want to be able to **add** Airbnbs to my properties
- As the user, I want to have the option of saving all the properties along with reservations associated with them
- As a user, I want to have the option of loading all the properties along with reservations associated with them from file

### DISCLAIMER: I did not realize my user stories did not fulfill the adding an arbitrary amount of X to Ys requirement during phase 0. I changed my stories and adapted my application to fulfill this requirement.
